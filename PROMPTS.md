   - Wait for market administrator approval (if required)
   - Ensure all links are working and accessible
   - Test the agent functionality before final submission

5. **Update Your Frontend**:
   - Add link to your agent's market listing in scaffold-worker/app/page.tsx
   - Update the agent market link section to include your specific agent URL
   - Ensure consistency between market listing and frontend information

**Note:** If the agent market has a specific API or submission format, follow their documentation. Otherwise, use the web interface at https://agent-market.leeduckgo.com/agents.
```

## STEP3: Generate the .env file.

**Prompt:**
```
You need to configure environment variables for both the frontend and backend of your AI Agent Worker.

**For Frontend (scaffold-worker/.env.local):**

Create a file at `scaffold-worker/.env.local` with the following content:

```bash
# x402 Server URL
# For local development, use: http://localhost:4403
# For production, use: https://x402.leeduckgo.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_X402_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4403
```

**For Backend (deno-server/.env or environment variables):**

Set the following environment variables in your shell or create a `.env` file in the `deno-server/` directory:

```bash
# Required: Movement blockchain wallet address to receive payments
# This should be your agent's payment wallet address (the MOVEMENT_PAY_TO address)
MOVEMENT_PAY_TO=0xYourMovementWalletAddress

# Optional: Server port (defaults to 4403 if not set)
PORT=4403

# Optional: Facilitator URL for x402 protocol payment verification
# Default: https://facilitator.stableyard.fi
FACILITATOR_URL=https://facilitator.stableyard.fi
```

**Instructions:**

1. **Generate Frontend .env.local**:
   - Navigate to `scaffold-worker/` directory
   - Create `.env.local` file (this file is already in .gitignore and won't be committed)
   - Add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_X402_SERVER_URL` variable
   - Use `http://localhost:4403` for local development
   - Use `https://x402.leeduckgo.com` for production (after backend deployment)

2. **Configure Backend Environment Variables**:
   - Option A: Export in your shell session:
     ```bash
     export MOVEMENT_PAY_TO="0xYourActualWalletAddress"
     export PORT=4403
     ```
   - Option B: Create `.env` file in `deno-server/` directory (if your Deno setup supports it)
   - Option C: Set in your deployment platform (Deno Deploy, Vercel, etc.)

3. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Ensure `MOVEMENT_PAY_TO` matches the wallet address you want to receive payments
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_X402_SERVER_URL` in frontend matches your backend server URL
   - Test the connection between frontend and backend

4. **Security Notes**:
   - Never commit `.env.local` or `.env` files to git (they're already in .gitignore)
   - For production deployments, set environment variables in your deployment platform's settings
   - Keep your wallet private keys secure and never expose them in environment variables

**Example Complete Setup:**

Frontend (`scaffold-worker/.env.local`):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_X402_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4403
```

Backend (shell environment or deployment platform):
```bash
MOVEMENT_PAY_TO=0x5cf8ed0e6b49da5d87ba69c4e50aa9b78c57bf0dd446f9889c8f8b5e57b0f336
PORT=4403
```
```

## STEP4: Generate a Chatbot for your Agent.

**Prompt:**
```
You need to create a chatbot interface for your AI Agent's free tier functionality. This chatbot will be accessible to all users without payment.

**Option 1: Using ChatGPT GPTs (Recommended for Quick Setup)**

1. **Create a Custom GPT**:
   - Go to https://chat.openai.com/ and navigate to GPT creation
   - Or use direct link: https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor
   - Click "Create a GPT" button

2. **Configure Your GPT**:
   - **Name**: Use your agent's name (from STEP1)
   - **Description**: Use your agent's description (from STEP1)
   - **Instructions**: Provide detailed instructions on how the chatbot should behave:
     ```
     You are [Agent Name], an AI agent that [Agent Description].
     
     Your capabilities include:
     - [Capability 1]
     - [Capability 2]
     - [Capability 3]
     
     Guidelines:
     - [Guideline 1]
     - [Guideline 2]
     
     Remember to [specific behavior or constraints].
     ```
   - **Conversation Starters**: Add 3-5 example prompts users can click
   - **Knowledge**: Upload any relevant files or documentation
   - **Capabilities**: Enable Code Interpreter, Web Browsing, or DALL-E as needed

3. **Publish Your GPT**:
   - Save and publish your GPT
   - Copy the public URL (format: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-XXXXXXXXX-agent-name)
   - This URL will be used in your frontend

4. **Update Frontend**:
   - In `scaffold-worker/app/page.tsx`, update the chatbot link:
     ```tsx
     <a
       href="YOUR_CHATGPT_GPT_URL"
       target="_blank"
       rel="noopener noreferrer"
       className="..."
     >
       [Your Agent Name] ChatBot
       <ExternalLink className="h-4 w-4" />
     </a>
     ```

**Option 2: Custom Chatbot Implementation (Advanced)**

If you want full control, implement a custom chatbot:

1. **Choose a Framework**:
   - OpenAI Chat Completions API
   - Anthropic Claude API
   - LangChain with custom LLM
   - Or other AI service provider

2. **Implement Chat Interface**:
   - Create a chat component in `scaffold-worker/components/`
   - Use React state management for conversation history
   - Integrate with your chosen AI API
   - Handle streaming responses if desired

3. **Add to Frontend**:
   - Create a route: `scaffold-worker/app/chat/page.tsx`
   - Implement the chat UI with message bubbles, input field, send button
   - Style with Tailwind CSS to match your existing design

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Add API keys to `.env.local`:
     ```bash
     OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # or your chosen provider's key
     ```

**Option 3: Embed External Chatbot Service**

Use services like:
- Voiceflow
- Tawk.to
- Crisp
- Intercom

And embed the widget in your frontend.

**Recommended Approach:**
For a scaffold/prototype, use Option 1 (ChatGPT GPTs) as it's the fastest to set up and requires no additional infrastructure. For production with custom behavior, use Option 2.

**After Creating Chatbot:**

1. Test the chatbot thoroughly with various prompts
2. Ensure it aligns with your agent's description and capabilities
3. Update the free tier section in your frontend with the chatbot link
4. Document the chatbot URL in your agent market registration (STEP2)
```
